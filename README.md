# Description
Here's a postgreSQL database I created as my final proyect of a SQL course. 

It contains the following entities: 

. Students

. Classes

. Professors

. Subjects

The idea behind it is to:

. Allow students to review professors (anonymously) and for other students to later read those reviews and pick the best professor.

. Store students, classes, professors, and subjects.

To read more about the details, ideas, relationships between entities, design, optimiation and limitations, please open the DESIGN.txt

To view the entire schema, open the Schema.pgsql

To view a few test cases and possible queries, open the queries.pgsql
